Audio effect device to modulate parameters in integer values and PAL/NTSC like interlace frame rates.
Deeply influenced by tracker software and chiptune plugins.

Features
- Designed to modulate integer parameters such as semitone, octave, and waveform types in instrument devices or plugins.
- Also able to modulate float-value parameters by scaled values.
- 4 parameters can be mapped to individual modulations, which sync to the master clock of the device.

The midi effect version (which the author prefers) is below.

Changes in version 1.3.2 (January 10, 2022)
- Fixed grammar mistakes in info view for text boxes.

Changes in version 1.3.1 (May 11, 2021)
- Fixed an issue when sliders before the position of loop start look dark and inactive.
- Fixed an issue when the values below sliders cannot display properly when the value is -100 or less.

Changes in version 1.3.0 (February 26, 2021)
- Now able to route from 'MIDI To'. (only for Live 11.0 or later) The modulation restarts when the device receives note on like hitting the Resync button.
- Fixed an issue when automation set to values might be canceled by changing certain parameters.
- Fixed an issue when mapping parameters might not work with certain conditions.

Changes in version 1.2.1 (December 13, 2020)
- Added Live standard loop selector which can adjust the start position of the loop.
- The phase of the master clock restarts by hitting the Resync button thus the first frame modulates in proper duration.
