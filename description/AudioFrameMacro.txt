Audio effect device to modulate parameters in low-resolution and PAL/NTSC like interlace frame rates.
Deeply influenced by tracker software and chiptune plugins.

Features
- Designed to modulate integer parameters such as semitone, octave and waveform types in instrument devices or plugins.
- Also able to modulate float-value parameters by scaled values.
- 4 parameters can be mapped to individual modulations, which sync to the master clock of the device.

The midi effect version (which the author prefers) is below.

Changes in version 1.2.1 (December 13, 2020)
- Added Live standard loop selector which can adjust start position of the loop.
- The phase of the master clock restarts by hitting Resync button thus the first frame modulates in proper duration.
- Fixed the issues when automation set to values might be cancelled by changing certain parameters.
