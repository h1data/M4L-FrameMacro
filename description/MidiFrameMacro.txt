MIDI effect device to modulate parameters in integer values and PAL/NTSC like interlace frame rates.
Deeply influenced by tracker software and chiptune plugins.

Features
- Designed to modulate integer parameters such as semitone, octave, and waveform types in instrument devices or plugins.
- Also able to modulate float-value parameters by scaled values.
- 4 parameters can be mapped to individual modulations, which sync to the master clock of the device.
- Each modulation restarts in sync with note on. The adjustable loop selector makes effects for attack and long notes.
